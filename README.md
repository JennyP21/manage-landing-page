# Manage Landing Page

Welcome to Manage Landing Page! Visit our live website at https://manage-landing.jennypatel.dev/.

This is a challange project by Frontend Mentor. It helped me sharpen my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills.

I have used many modern CSS techniques to build and design the project, such as Flex, Grid, Snap Scrolling, Absolute Positioning and many more. 

This project is also responsive which will work on smaller devices making it an excellent user experience.

## How to install the project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
    
    `git clone https://github.com/JennyP21/manage-landing-page.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory.

    `cd manage-landing-page`
   
4. Launch the Project.

    `Open index.html in any browser or your choice`
